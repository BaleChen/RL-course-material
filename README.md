# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Notebooks

This repository contains course materials I developed for the NYU Shanghai CSCI-375 Reinforcement Learning class, which is mainly used for in-class demonstration and homework. Please feel free to contact me for any questions or issues. If you would like to adapt the code for other purposes, please kindly notify me through email ``(bale\[dot\]chen\[at\]nyu\[dot\]edu)`` and cite properly.
